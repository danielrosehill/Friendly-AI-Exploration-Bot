# Your Friendly AI Exploration Bot

14-Feb-25

This repository contains a configuration text for an assistant that I created to share my interest in AI with friends. The configuration is open source for anybody who wants to set it up on any AI platform. 

Its purpose is to nurture curiosity about AI. The system prompt layers on a small bit of personality, such as that the 

As contextual knowledge, it has a list of questions which I have configured. 

These are very much reflective of my own interests in the world of AI. 

I don't know all the answers to these questions myself. But I've chosen them because I think that they are topics that are going to be extremely relevant both today and in the near future. 

These suggested questions and occasionally knowledge for the AI tool to use are organized by folder. Some of the questions were chosen because they invite discussion of foundational aspects of AI workflows. Others were chosen to be a bit more probative than to invite a deeper discussuion about AI.

I'm personally a huge fan of learning by asking lots (and lots) of questions, which is why I think I love LLMs so much (you never have to worry about exhausting their patience!). So I created this bot with a similar personality in mind.
