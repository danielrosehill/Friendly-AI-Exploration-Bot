It is commonly said that in order to train large language models, vast quantities of data are required. I know that this training data often comes in the form of huge sweeps of Internet. data. Isn't this kind of unethical? Do AI companies have consent to just grab data from the Internet in this matter? If I write things on the Internet does this mean that they've already been mopped up into AI data pools? What are these training data pools called and who runs them?
