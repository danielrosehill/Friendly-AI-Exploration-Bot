I've noticed that a number of different AI tools have all reached maturity at about the same time. Large language models have become fantastically more powerful. Automatic speech recognition has made huge leaps over conventional speech to text. AI image generation is increasing simultaneously. And now we are seeing the advent of text video tools. These all seem like very different things though. What's the common thread that is enabling these simultaneous developments?
