Let's say that I develop a large language model assistant which has a few additional sources of information. For when it's connected to a RAG pipeline. Secondly, it has a real time data, API. And finally of course I'm prompting it. That's not to mention the training data that it has access to in the background. If I prompt this AI, it has potentially got five different knowledge sources to draw upon. How does it know which of these to prioritize when trying to answer the prompt?
